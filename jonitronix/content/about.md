I'm Joni Hanski, software developer, mathematician, AI and data science enthusiast, living in Finland. This page is basically a container for multiple interests of mine, hobby projects, blog that's written for both myself, and the occasional recruiter who I'll be directing to check out this site to see what they'd be hiring. If you are here for some other reason, do send me a message. I'd love to hear your story.

This site started its journey 7th of September, 2023.

The source code for the site is available here: https://github.com/Jonii/Jonitronix/

You can reach me at first name + last name at gmail.com.
