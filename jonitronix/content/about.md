I'm Joni Hanski, backend developer living in Finland. This page is basically a container for multiple interests of mine, hobby projects, blog that's written for both myself, and the occasional recruiter who I'll be directing to check out this site to see what they'd be hiring. If you are here for some other reason... Well, at the moment, there's no way to contact me through this site, but if you wouldn't mind waiting a few days and coming back, I'm really curious to hear how did you end up here.

The source code for the site is available here: https://github.com/Jonii/Jonitronix/
