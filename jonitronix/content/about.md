I'm Joni Hanski, software developer, mathematician, AI and data science enthusiast from Finland, currently living in Poznan, Poland. This page serves mostly as a tool for job hunting, and overall an experiment on establishing internet presence. I also plan on publishing here interesting recruiter-friendly hobby projects.

This site started its journey 7th of September, 2023.
